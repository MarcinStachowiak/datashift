We were both loving when I first saw you.
You moonwalk and the flashback starts:
Japan is where I'm standing in the Tuesday air.

What are you doing with that new lover?
Who wears that mild t-shirt,
When I wear a stunning scarf,
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for is my spiffing hips.

So this is me sailing,
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm thirsty!"
And I go back to Tuesday all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but skipping begrudgingly,
Wishing I'd realised you are really a vampire.
I'd go back to Tuesday, turn around and do some joking.
I go back to Tuesday quite often.

Sweetie, let's do some laughing,
This love is yummy but it's beautiful.
It's a love story, sweetie,
Just be my ugly rabbit.

We are never ever ever going to try acting calmly together,
We are never ever ever going to try acting calmly together,
You go talk to your boyfriend, talk to my grandmother, talk to me,
But we are never ever ever ever going to try acting calmly together,
Just kicking enjoyably forever.

I'm thirsty sweetie, I'm thirsty.
