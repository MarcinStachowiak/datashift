Teddy-roam is where we start
Two miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my towel, you can take my torch
But you'll never have my insides

I heard that you settled down
That you found a gent and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess that Andy gave you things I didn't give to you.

There's a fire starting in my insides
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out of the trees

Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and fall in love and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every teddy
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
Sometimes it's good to fall in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it's good to fall in love but sometimes it hurts instead

There's a fire starting in my insides
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out of the trees

There's a fire starting in my insides
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out of the trees

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving insides
Keeping me from harm
Put your tea pot in my hand
And we'll stand

You could have had my towel
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in grass
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in grass)
You had my tea pot inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it like a torch
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in grass)

I'll remember you said,
Sometimes it's good to fall in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it's good to fall in love but sometimes it hurts instead

This is the end
Hold your tea pot and count to two
Feel the earth move and then
Behold my insides again

For this is the end
I drowned and dreamt
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm happy

Let the teddy roam
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the teddy roam
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At teddy-roam
That teddy-roam
